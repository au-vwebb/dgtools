== Features

* Show the time zone of your team members.

* Use a config file to configure your time zones.

* List all time zones so you can easily edit your config file.

== Motivation

Replacement for my `date` based https://github.com/DavidGamba/bin/blob/96468fe1ebfdc81972dad0b56a11b8023f3f639b/tz[tz] script.

== City time zone information

Information obtained by going to http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/ and downloading the `cities15000.zip` file.

Then a sqlite3 db is generated using the command:

----
sqlite3 cities.db < db.schema
----

Finally, the following query is used to generate an export:

----
sqlite3 cities.db ".headers off" ".mode tabs" "select distinct asciiname,countrycode,timezone from cities15000;"  > cities15000-tz.tsv
----

The TSV is bundled in the binary (The resulting TSV is smaller than its CSV and JSON counterparts).
